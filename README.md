**TODO:**
---
**Part 1:**
Please clone this repository and run existing app

Main goal is to create separate screen with detailed information of selected hero
+ follow MVVM architecture guidelines
+ create CharacterDetailsViewController (try to do it without storyboard)
  * follow designs from directory '/designs'  (You should be able to run it using free Adobe XD)
  * make a call to the correct API endpoint to get proper data (don't rely on data from the list view)
  * hint: not all of the required fields are available in Character model at the moment

**Part 2:**

Table view from CharactersListViewController currently shows only first page of results from API response.
Update this view to use pagination - show next page of results using infinity scroll.

---
**Part 3:**
Configure and add unit tests that will cover the view models
